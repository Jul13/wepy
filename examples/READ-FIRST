This folder contains sample python scripts intended to help the reader learn python. We provide only scripts as it is
 as convenient as notebooks and avoids problems with version control.

The setup you should use to test scripts is a matlab-like interface like PyCharm immediate execution of selection
(Alt+Maj+E).

You can start by opening 'lean-matplotlib.py FIRST' in PyCharm and execute it line by line (Control+Shift+E, you may
add F9 shortcut if you are used to matlab).
Then numpy and pandas are both asking whether they might be SECOND.
